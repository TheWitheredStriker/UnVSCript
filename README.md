# UNVSCript

UnrealScript Language server and plugin for Visual Studio Code, based on [adamvoss/vscode-languageserver-java-example](https://github.com/adamvoss/vscode-languageserver-java-example).

Forked by me, as the original repo had not been updated since 2018. I rewrote the language server from Java into Kotlin and added many, _many_ overlooked keywords. I plan to eventually make this repo double as grammar file for UnrealScript on GitHub (through Linguist).

**This extension is no longer maintained. Only the grammar file will still receive updates (if need be), as I plan to submit it to Linguist.**
